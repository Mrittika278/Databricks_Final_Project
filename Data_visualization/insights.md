1️⃣ Revenue by Product Category

Insight:
Revenue is not evenly distributed across product categories, indicating that a small number of categories act as primary revenue drivers. This suggests that business growth strategies should prioritize inventory optimization, pricing, and marketing efforts around these high-performing categories rather than spreading resources uniformly.

2️⃣ Transaction Count by Product Category

Insight:
Some product categories show high transaction volume but comparatively lower revenue, indicating frequent low-value purchases. These categories are ideal candidates for bundling, cross-selling, or subscription-based strategies to increase average order value.

3️⃣ Revenue by Country (Top 10)

Insight:
Revenue concentration across a limited set of countries highlights geographic dependency. This insight can guide regional expansion strategies, localized marketing campaigns, and logistics planning to strengthen presence in high-performing regions while identifying under-penetrated markets.

4️⃣ Payment Method Usage Distribution

Insight:
The dominance of certain payment methods reflects customer trust and convenience preferences. Ensuring high reliability and seamless integration for the most-used payment methods is critical, as disruptions here would directly impact transaction completion rates.

5️⃣ Average Spend by Product Category

Insight:
Categories with higher average spend represent premium purchasing behavior. These segments can be leveraged for targeted upselling, personalized recommendations, and loyalty programs, while lower average spend categories can be optimized for volume-driven strategies.

6️⃣ Age Group vs Average Spend

Insight:
Spending behavior varies significantly across age groups, indicating that demographic segmentation plays a key role in purchasing power. This insight supports age-specific marketing, product positioning, and promotional strategies to maximize conversion and revenue effectiveness.

7️⃣ Transactions Over Time (Daily Trend)

Insight:
Fluctuations in daily transaction volume reveal temporal demand patterns, which are essential for operational planning. Identifying peak and low-activity periods can help optimize staffing, infrastructure scaling, and promotional timing.

8️⃣ Revenue Over Time

Insight:
Revenue trends over time provide visibility into business momentum and stability. Consistent upward trends indicate healthy growth, while volatility may signal seasonality or sensitivity to external factors, informing forecasting and risk management decisions.

9️⃣ Customer Spending Tier Analysis (Low / Medium / High Spenders)

Insight:
A small segment of high spenders contributes disproportionately to overall revenue, reflecting a classic value concentration pattern. Retaining and rewarding these customers is strategically more impactful than acquiring large volumes of low-value customers.

🔟 Purchase Frequency vs Average Spend (Customer Behavior Scatter Plot)

Insight:
Customers exhibit distinct behavioral clusters—frequent low spenders versus infrequent high spenders. Recognizing these patterns enables differentiated engagement strategies, such as loyalty incentives for frequent buyers and premium experiences for high-value customers.
